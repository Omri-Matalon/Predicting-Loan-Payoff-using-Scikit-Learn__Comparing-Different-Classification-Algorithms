# Predicting Loan Payoff vs. Collection using Scikit-Learn: Comparing Different Classification Algorithms

## Introduction
In this project, costumer loan payoff was predicted using the following classification algorithms: 

- k-nearest neighbors (KNN)
- Decision Trees
- Support-vector machine (SVM)
- Logistic Regression

To train and evaluate the accuracy of the classification algorithms, a dataset of past loans was used, which include details of 346 customers whose loan were already paid off or defaulted. The performance of the different classifiers was then evaluated on a test set and their accuracy results were summarized and compared.
